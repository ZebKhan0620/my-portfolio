# Production Deployment Checklist

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING ⚠️
Real credentials were found in configuration files. If these files were ever committed to a repository, consider all credentials compromised.

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**
- [ ] Change all passwords, API keys, and secrets that were previously exposed
- [ ] Rotate the MongoDB connection string
- [ ] Change the Gmail/SMTP password that was exposed
- [ ] Generate a new JWT secret for the backend
- [ ] Verify no credentials remain in any committed files
- [ ] Check all commit history to ensure credentials are removed from git history

## Before Deployment

### Environment Variables
Set the following environment variables in your Vercel project settings:

- `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Secure password for admin access
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`: Your production domain (e.g., https://your-domain.com)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME`: Your site name
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_DESCRIPTION`: Description for SEO purposes
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_EMAIL`: Your contact email address
- `ENABLE_ANALYTICS`: Set to "true" to enable analytics

### Security Checks
- [x] Removed hardcoded credentials from codebase
- [x] Enhanced admin authentication with rate limiting
- [x] Implemented secure password comparison
- [x] Removed test/debug routes and components from production build
- [x] Secured cookies with HttpOnly and Secure flags
- [x] Added proper error handling in API routes
- [x] Implemented security headers in middleware
- [x] Created robots.txt and security.txt
- [x] Added error and 404 pages
- [x] Replaced hardcoded email addresses with environment variables

### Performance Optimization
- [x] Configured Next.js for production performance
- [x] Disabled source maps in production
- [x] Optimized image loading and rendering
- [x] Enabled gzip compression
- [x] Added appropriate caching headers
- [x] Implemented optimized loading states

## Vercel Deployment Instructions

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure the build settings:
   - Build Command: `NEXT_DISABLE_ESLINT=1 next build`
   - Output Directory: `.next`
   - Install Command: `npm install`
3. Set all environment variables listed above
4. Deploy the project

## Final Steps Before Going Live ⚠️

1. **CRITICAL: Credential Security**
   - Rotate all previously exposed credentials (see warning section)
   - Use environment variables for all sensitive data
   - Consider using a password manager for team credential management
   - Implement a secret rotation policy

2. **Update Domain Configuration**:
   - Configure custom domain in Vercel
   - Set up DNS records
   - Enable HTTPS with automatic SSL certificate

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Double-check all environment variables are set correctly
   - Replace all placeholder values with actual production values
   - Make sure no development credentials are used in production

4. **Content and SEO**:
   - Replace any placeholder images or text
   - Update meta descriptions and titles
   - Configure favicon and app icons

5. **Testing**:
   - Perform end-to-end testing of all features
   - Test on multiple browsers and devices
   - Check all forms and API endpoints

## Post-Deployment

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Verify MongoDB connection works
- [ ] Test admin authentication
- [ ] Check all API routes for proper functionality
- [ ] Verify image loading and optimization
- [ ] Test form submissions
- [ ] Verify internationalization features
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Run Lighthouse audit for performance, accessibility, and SEO

### SEO and Analytics
- [ ] Verify meta tags are correctly populated
- [ ] Check structured data
- [ ] Submit sitemap to search engines
- [ ] Set up analytics tracking
- [ ] Verify robots.txt configuration

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up error monitoring
- [ ] Configure performance monitoring
- [ ] Set up uptime checks
- [ ] Establish database monitoring

## Regular Maintenance

- [ ] Check for security updates regularly
- [ ] Monitor database performance
- [ ] Review error logs weekly
- [ ] Update content as needed
- [ ] Run regular backups

## Database Backup Strategy

1. Set up automated MongoDB backups
2. Store backups in a secure location
3. Test backup restoration periodically
4. Document backup and restoration procedures
